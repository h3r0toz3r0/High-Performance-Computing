Title
Readme for M-M: Matrix-Matrix Multiplication Optimization

Description
This program utilizes two methods to improve M-M program.
First - it utilizes OMP to parallelize the for loop. It uses the following omp commands:
    #pragma omp parallel shared(a,b,c) private(i,j,k) 
    #pragma omp for  schedule(static)
Second - it reorders the j and k for loops to optimize the cache. 
    The k index on the inner-most loop causes cache misses in matrix b every iteration

Usage
gcc -fopenmp <filename>.c -o <filename>
./<filename>
    OR 
chmod u+x testing-MM.sh
./testing-MM.sh

Environment
I ran this program on the COE server. 

Testing
I wrote a bash script called "testing-MM.sh" that iterated through 
the program (both optimized and original) 5 times. 
Next I averaged the time to complete the loop over the 5 iterations.

Results
Average time to complete for original code (milliseconds)   =   915.662
Average time to complete for optimized code (milliseconds)  =   88.756
