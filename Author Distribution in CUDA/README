Title
Readme for Question 2: Author Distribution in CUDA

Description
This program utilizes 1 GPU with CUDA to count the number of co-authors per unique author. It then prints out the author(s) with the largest number of co-authors.
This program also sorts all author's by number of co-authors to create a histogram distribution cart with the number of authors on the x-axis and number of co-authors on the y-axis.

Usage
Turn on or off debug with:
        0   Print histogram
        1   Print file lines to ensure readability of file
        2   Print summation of coauthors per author
        3   Print max co-authors with respective author and execution time
Change the file name on line 74. Note, the file given must only have the data within in (no comments or additional statements).

nvcc q2.cu -o q2
srun --pty --nodes 1 --job-name=interactive --partition=gpu --reservation=EECE5640 --gres=gpu:1 ./q2

Environment
I ran this program on the Discovery Cluster.

Testing
For testing this program, I turned debug on (#DEFINE DEBUG true). 
I then manually counted various author's co-authors and checked the values with the printed values.
