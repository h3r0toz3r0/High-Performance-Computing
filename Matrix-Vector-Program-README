Title
Readme for Question 4: OpenMP Matrix-Vector Multiplication

Description
This program utilizes OpenMP to parallelize the workload across threads. It performs a matrix-vector multiplication utilizing OpenMP for reduction in the matrix_vector_multiply() function.

Usage
To change size of the matrix, change the number on line 15 for MATRIX_SIZE.
To change the randomization of the matrix and vector initialization numbers, change lines 81 and 85.

g++ -fopenmp q4.cpp -o <filename>
./<filename>

Environment
I ran this program on the COE server. Specs provided in the homework write up.

Testing
For testing this program, I turned debug on (#DEFINE DEBUG true). 
This prints the first row of the matrix and the vector. 
Then I calculated the first value of the matrix-vector multiply manually to ensure this was the same value being printed.
