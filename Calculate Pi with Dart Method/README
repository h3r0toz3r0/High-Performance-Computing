Title
Readme for Question 1: Calculate Pi using Dart Method

Description
This program utilizes MPI to calculate pi with the dart method on the Discovery Cluster.
The dart method works by randomly throwing darts onto a board, and counting the number that land within the unit circle.
The number within the unit circle are used to calculate pi.

Usage
Turn on or off debug with macro 1 = true, 0 = false
Change number of darts or rounds in command line
Change number of tasks in the srun command "tasks-per-node=__"

mpicc q1.c -o q1
srun --pty --export=ALL --nodes=1 --tasks-per-node=3 mpirun --mca btl_base_warn_component_unused 0  q1 <num_of_rounds> <number_of_darts>

Environment
I ran this program on the Discovery Cluster.

Testing
For testing this program, I turned debug on (#DEFINE DEBUG true). 
This prints out the tasks working.
Next, I ran this over different dart values and observed the calculated pi value change.
